This is was a group project complete during the Computer Programming course at Alogonquin College Ottawa.

The Project consists of 4 seperate group members work.
Each group member was tasked with designing and creating an android application given a topic and list of required implementations.
Each group member had their own topic and list of required implementations.
When all the project were complete we were then tasked with combining the applications into one larger application with all the features implemented.
Once Complete the application was marked as a whole and by each individual group members section of the app.

This project was created using Android Studio in Java.
